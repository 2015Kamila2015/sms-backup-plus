#Analysing ACRA error reports with the Google visualisation API

If you use [ACRA][] to monitor crashes in your
Android app you can easily create reports using the [Google Visualization
API][].

However you'll need to set the sharing settings to "Anyone with the link" or
public.

Take a look at `acra-analyis.html` and change the Spreadsheet link to your own
spreadsheet, it should just work.
