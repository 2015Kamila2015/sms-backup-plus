#Analysing ACRA error reports with the Google visualisation API

If you use [ACRA][] to monitor crashes in your
Android app you can easily create realtime error reports using the [Google Visualization
API][].

However you'll need to set the sharing settings of the spreadsheet to "Anyone
with the link" or public.

Take a look at [acra-analysis.html][] and change the Spreadsheet link to your own
spreadsheet, it should just work.
